This program deploys a simple set of nodes that are coordinated through Helix with the AUTO_REBALANCE mode. 


The nodes do nothing except report state transitions.

We user a basic LEADER-REPLICA state model.

### Running the program

Simplest way is `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="test.TestRebalancing"`
